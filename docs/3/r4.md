## Alternative and public container registries


### Azure Container Registry

We start from the basis of having the azure-cli and a group of resources with an associated active billing method. First we create a record to our resource group:


```
az acr create --resource-group pepitoHaceCloudComputing --name pepitoregistry -sku Basic
```

We check in the azure portal that the record has been created correctly.

We log in to manage the registry, create an image tag and upload our image to the registry (private)

We modify the networking rules of our registry:

We check that we can make use of this image from the registry.
