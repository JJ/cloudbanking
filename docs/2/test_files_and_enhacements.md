# Testing and/or advancement of the project itself beyond the basics, including suggestions made in corrections and evaluations of previous milestones

Suggestions
- [x] Remove all reference of login
- [x] DO NOT SAVE password 
- [x] Do not manage authentication. 
- [x] Reach a minimum viable product
- [x] Classes are capable of doing something.
- [x] I demonstrate that the classes are syntactically correct by means of two continuous integration systems. If they pass the tests, it is because it compiles, if it compiles it is because it is syntactically correct. In addition, you can find a release in the root of the CloudBanking repository.
- [ ] Create enum. I will not force the use of enum in my project if I do not need it.
