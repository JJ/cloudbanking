## Circleci

###  Vinculando Github con Circleci

The first step is to go to the main [page of the platform](http://circleci.com).

We signed up with Github and authorized Circleci

![](img/r3/01.png)
![](img/r3/02.png)

We select which organization we are under (this is because a repository can be authorized by several users)
![](img/r3/03.png)

We see the list of available repositories and select **cloudbanking**

We leave the welcome file to check that the basic pipeline runs correctly, and then modify it to our needs.

We check that it runs correctly and become familiar with the Circleci interface

It is time to establish our own pipeline, to do so we modify the file `.circleci/config.yml`


The most current configuration file can be found in the repository [cloudbanking](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/cloudbanking/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml).

The historical moment of addition of this file and therefore its origin can be found in the commit [#8ec423d](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/cloudbanking/commit/8ec423d73c48ad5e112b6923bad68f91c0e1c5b9#diff-78a8a19706dbd2a4425dd72bdab0502ed7a2cef16365ab7030a5a0588927bf47)


```yaml
# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      # Seleccting the same rust version of our Dockerfile.
      # Important for tokio and warp packages.

    environment:
      # Changing TZ for correct testing of BankAccount and Card

    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          # Recover a previous cache key (see -save_cache)
          key: cloudbanking-cache

      - run:

          command: |

      - save_cache:
          # Saving cache in cache['cloudbanking-cache']
          # cache['cloudbanking-cache'][0] = "./target"
          # cache['cloudbanking-cache'][1] = "~/.cargo"
          # cache['cloudbanking-cache'][2] = "/usr/local/cargo/registry"
          key: cloudbanking-cache
          paths:
            - "./target"
            - "~/.cargo"
            - "/usr/local/cargo/registry"
```


### File explanation

We define a single phase of construction in which we define the execution of our environment on a docker image.
This docker image can be defined as a CircleCI image or a DockerHub image. In our case, we use a CircleCI own image because it facilitates the process of caching the dependencies and saves us time in each execution. Version 1.48 of rust is selected as the base container, making it coincide with the base version necessary for the execution of our project.

In this file we express in sequences the tasks to be performed. We start with a list of the rust compiler and package manager versions, then we generate the dependency file, and then we execute the tests.
This can be seen expressed in each **run** element that hangs from the **steps** element.

It's worth mentioning that we save the cache of our project's dependencies in a key called **cloudbanking-cache** that we retrieve before starting the next execution of the *pipeline*. 

A necessary issue for our project is to correctly configure the *TimeZone* since we use the *NaiveDateTime* data type that depends on the time zone of the running machine. This way, when it passes the date test, it will not give an error when matching what it expected (date and time based on Madrid as TZ). Nobody assures us that it will run on a machine with correct TZ (most likely it will be on a machine with TZ America configuration)

We make a change in the repository and complete with commit and push to launch the defined *pipeline*.

If we observe the details of the execution of the *pipeline* we can check that all the execution was correct, that the project passes the tests and that it is done as it is expressed in the CircleCI configuration file, that is, step by step, with the specific rust version, and saving the cache for the next execution
