## Roadmap


### Development

In a __first phase__ I want to achieve a minimum viable product. In a first phase I want to achieve a minimum viable product like: __bank account__ and __bank card__ .On the other hand, we should be able to create an account as a client user and be able to log in.
* [(HU1) Add bank account as customer user user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/13)
* [(HU2) Add bank-card as customer user](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/14)
* [(HU14) Create account - register user](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/26)
* [(HU15) Loggin user](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/27)

In a __second phase__, I would develop additional functionalities with non-core entities such as __fund investment__, __payment group__ and __saving group__. 
* [(HU3) Add investment fund as customer user](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/15)
* [(HU7) Create saving-group user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/19)
* [(HU9) Create a payment-group user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/21)

In a __third phase__ it would be ideal to be able to carry out a minimal management with an administrator user. So the following user stories would be covered:
* [(H17) Disable account](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/29)
* [(H18) Enable disabled account](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/30)

In a __fourth phase__ of development it would be necessary to enable the ability to remove financial products from the user account, thus covering the following user stories
* [(HU4) Delete bank account as customer user user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/16)
* [(HU5) Delete bank card as customer user user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/17)
* [(HU6) Delete fund investment as customer user user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/18)
* [(HU8) Exit from saving-group user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/20)
* [(HU10) Exit from payment-group](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/22)
* [(HU16) Erase Account](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/28)

In a __fifth phase__ of development it would be ideal to implement the functionalities related to the creation of alerts on financial products.
* [(HU11) Create alert-trigger for bank-account movement user-stories](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/23)
* [(HU12) Create alert-trigger for bank-card movement](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/24)
* [(HU13) Create alert-trigger for fund investment movement](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CloudBanking/issues/25)

The implementation of the respective __system logs__ would be transversal to the whole project

### Testing


### Encapsulation in containers


### Evaluation and Acquisition of the virtual infrastructure


### Measurement and Estimation of Costs and Performance


### Software Deployment and Orchestration
